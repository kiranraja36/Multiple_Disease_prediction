# Multiple_Disease_prediction
Disease Prediction is a Machine Learning based system which primarily works according to the symptoms given by a user. The disease is predicted using algorithms and comparison of the datasets with the symptoms provided by the user.

# PROJECT OVERVIEW
The answer to calculate risk through diseases via model-based prediction is very difficult. Due to this, the examination of several medical datasets and their forecasting using soft computing is very handy and a cheaper way for professionals in the healthcare industry. These techniques include exploratory analysis and constructive models that support the professional in statistical decision-making, which is a massive requirement of the medical industry. The high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, peculiar pulse rate, and various other risk factors make it harder to detect illnesses.
One of the common illnesses that might shorten a person's lifespan today is heart disease. Heart disease leads to the deaths of 17.5 million individuals worldwide each year. Since the heart is an integral part of our bodies, its proper operation is essential to life. Heart function is compromised by heart disease. For many purposes in clinical medicine and health advocacy, an estimate of a person's risk for coronary heart disease is vital. A prolonged study's multivariate regression analysis can be used to establish a risk prediction model. In an attempt to prevent falling victim to the rising trend of digital technology, which involves hospitals and other institutions storing their data in databases in the first place. The evaluation of different data at medical centers relies heavily on data mining techniques and machine learning algorithms. The methodologies and algorithms can be applied directly to a dataset to build models or draw important inferences and conclusions from the dataset. A medical condition called diabetes impacts how effectively our body uses food as fuel. The majority  
of the food we consume each day is metabolized into sugar, or glucose, and then absorbed by our bodies. In response to a spike in blood sugar, our pancreas  
releases insulin. If hyperglycemia is not consistently and carefully managed, blood sugar levels might rise, increasing the possibility of serious adverse consequences like heart attack and stroke. As a result, we plan to forecast using machine learning in Python.
